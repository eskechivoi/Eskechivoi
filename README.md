- 👋 Hi, I’m @ferrodr, and I am a student at University of Valladolid, in Spain.
- 👀 I’m interested in developing `software solutions for IT systems`, `OS administration` and `cybersecurity audit`. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++ and Java, for developing software solutions for IT systems; and Python, JS and Shell, for OS administration. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on developing software for IT systems. Specially, I would like to improve my skills in embedded IoT systems. 
- :mag_right: In my GitHub profile, you will find cryptographic software, fullstack websites, and some little proyects!
- 📫 How to reach me: Via linkedin
